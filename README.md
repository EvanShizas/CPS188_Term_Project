# Project Repository Information
CPS188 - Term Project

This is going to be the project folder where all the work for this term project will be completed.
Make sure that all the work done at an individual-level is saved in the respective member's folder, allowing for commits to be made to the main program upon all members being in agreement on the changes/additions made.

This README.md will be modified as the project moves along; make sure to stay updated on any new additions!
